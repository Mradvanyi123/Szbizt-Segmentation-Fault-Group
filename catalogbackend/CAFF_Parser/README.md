# CAFF file parser

## Requirements

`cmake` and `make`

## Compilation

Make a new directory for the build files:

`mkdir build && cd build`

Compile the files:

`cmake ..`

`make .`

After this the `CAFF_parser` binary should appear.

## Running

The basic syntax is: `CAFF_parser [input_file.caff] [output_file.caff]`.

The logfile is automatically located in the `logfile.txt`.
